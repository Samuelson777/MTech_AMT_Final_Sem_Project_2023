# Design and Manufacturing of Cutting Tool for Machining Profile on Inconel Shell

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and manufacturing of a cutting tool specifically for machining profiles on Inconel shells. Inconel is a high-heat resistant superalloy commonly used in aerospace, nuclear, and chemical applications. The cutting tool is designed to achieve precise and repeatable machining processes, ensuring high-quality profiles on the Inconel material.

## Objectives
- **Design** a cutting tool tailored for Inconel shell machining.
- **Plan** the manufacturing process for the cutting tool.
- **Manufacture** the cutting tool using advanced techniques.
- **Test** the cutting tool's performance and refine the design based on results.

## Key Features
- **Material Selection**: The project utilizes Tungsten Carbide for its hardness and wear resistance, making it suitable for machining Inconel.
- **CAD Modeling**: The cutting tool design is created using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, allowing for precise geometry and parameters.

- **Performance Testing**: The cutting tool is evaluated for its effectiveness in machining profiles on Inconel shells, with adjustments made based on testing outcomes.

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Research on existing cutting tools and their performance on Inconel.
2. **Design Phase**: Create 3D models of the cutting tool and tool holder.
3. **Manufacturing Phase**: Utilize CNC machining and Wire Cut EDM for tool production.
4. **Testing Phase**: Conduct machining tests and analyze results to refine the tool design.

## Results
- Successful machining of profiles on Inconel shells.
- Identification of issues such as chip clogging, leading to design adjustments (e.g., changing side clearance angles).
- Performance metrics indicating the cutting tool's effectiveness and durability.
